                <strong>🧸 School Days</strong><br>
                It all started in school... two girls who barely spoke to each other. Silent friends in the same classroom, sharing the same space but different worlds.
            </p>

            <p class="timeline-paragraph">
                <strong>💍 Bhaiya ki Shaadi</strong><br>
                Then came the wedding - a celebration that brought them together in unexpected ways. Dancing, laughing, and creating memories that would last forever.
            </p>

            <p class="timeline-paragraph">
                <strong>📚 10th Boards</strong><br>
                The stress of 10th boards hit hard. Late night study sessions, exam anxiety, and the pressure of growing up. But through it all, a friendship was quietly blooming.
            </p>

            <p class="timeline-paragraph">
                <strong>📱 The Reconnection</strong><br>
                That first text after so long... "Hey, how have you been?" Simple words that rekindled everything. Messages turned into calls, calls into conversations that lasted for hours.
            </p>

            <p class="timeline-paragraph">
                <strong>🤪 Hola Amigos Era</strong><br>
                The group chat chaos began! Memes, voice notes, random 3 AM messages, inside jokes that no one else understood. This was when friendship became family.
            </p>

            <p class="timeline-paragraph">
                <strong>💪 Present Day</strong><br>
                Here you are today - stronger than ever. Through ups and downs, laughter and tears, you've built something beautiful. A friendship that feels like home.
            </p>

            <p class="timeline-paragraph">
                <strong>✨ 2026 → ∞</strong><br>
                And the story continues... New years, new adventures, new memories waiting to be made. Some friendships are forever, and this is one of them. Happy New Year 2026! 💖
